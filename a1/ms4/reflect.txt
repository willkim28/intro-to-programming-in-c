1. I think this assignment has asked us to declare the struct Contact so that it becomes easier to manage the 3 different structs already declared, and readers of the code will be able to associate that the different structs are used in same purpose.

2. The most difficult part of the assignment was figuring out how to properly declare the pointers, (ex (*numbers).home), and learning how to call the functions declared in another source file.

3. Much longer than the combination of the previous milestones combined, a good few hours searching google and stackoverflow for hints on where I have gotten it wrong, and having the problem in the back of my head for the past week.
