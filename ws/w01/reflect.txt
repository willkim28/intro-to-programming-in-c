This workshop taught me that to create new lines, you would need to insert \n at the end of your strings in order to create new lines.
If you do not insert the \n escape sequence, the text would not be properly displayed, instead showing all the text in a single line.
Also, it taught me the valuable method of uploading files to a remote host using an SSH client and a SFTP client.
