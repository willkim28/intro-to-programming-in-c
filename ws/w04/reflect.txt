The arrays in this program had to be declared to hold 10 elements to specify that we only want 10 elements in the array. By declaring int high[10];, we specify that we want an array named high with 10 integer elements, and allocate contiguous storage as so in the RAM.

Parallel arrays have an advantage in being easy to read and utlize (ex. the high & low arrays in the workshop has the same number of elements, operates on the same index, but stores different value per index. The disadvantage of using a parallel array may arise from the confusion when there's a lack of documentation or intuitive relation between the arrays. If no information relates the arrays together, the index may be used in a wrong manner.

The home portion of the workshop was, conceptually, easier. It felt like a regurgitation of the lab component + Workshop 3, and the difficulty came from wrapping my head around the logic of getting the do-while and for loops in correct places, but the components themselves could be reused from the previous workshops.
