1. A function is a group of statements/commands that will perform a task. It is not productive to repeatedly write identical multiple lines of code, so functions are utilized. Due to its modular nature, it can compress the number of lines in a code, and can improve productivity by reusing functions in any language.

2. I think the helper functions were included in a separate file to help us understand the modularity of functions. By construction helper functions, and then injecting them to functions in contacts.c, it gave us a better understanding of how functions could be called and utilized.
